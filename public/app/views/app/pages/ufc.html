   <h4> UFC 220 was mirocic's playground</h4>
<img src="./ufc220wasmirocicsplayground.jpg"></img>
<p>Mirocic and Ngannou both shared their fair share of success going into UFC220.One stat that shows that is the fact that both had stoppage victories, at least going into the night.Mirocic victories stood out, having 3 of 5 of his knockouts which were displayed in the title fight.Some say this experience may have lead to the final result as mirocic made short work of Ngannou, finishing the contest in just five rounds.Another key reason that may have lead to Mirocic victory was the obvious early momentum shift by Mirocic.Some say this change was caused by the underestimation of Mirocic by Ngannou.The strategies of both men were clearly different as you could see early.Ngannou was very aggressive while Mirocic was very passive which lead to Mirocic success.Mirocic didn't even go for a takedown at 

 first.Mirrocic waited and paced himself until he knew Ngannou was tired and then picked his moment.His strategy worked and that what decided the fight.One can only imagine how far this victory will take Mirocic.
